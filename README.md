Some major components of this game are the paddles that are controlled by the players. My contribution to the game was creating the Paddle class that represents these paddles. This class has the initializer that takes in a position on the game screen (for the pddles to be placed) and two keys (s or w, up or down) that will be pressed to move the paddles. I also created a method for moving the paddles up and down. This method determines which key is pressed and moves the paddle accordingly by a certain amount that we specified in the game. For this readme.md, I created the 'Navigation' section and added to it the different components of this file. I also created the 'Liscense' section and a copy of our license. Finally, I created the 'Authors and their Contribution' section.
